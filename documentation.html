    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to build a complete web application
      (client-side and server-side) built using full-stack JavaScript
      technologies. The project will demonstrate full-stack JavaScript
      development, including APIs, web server frameworks, databases, business
      logic, authentication, data security, and more. The tech stack used is
      known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).
